# FInal-Project
For my project I will be working in a group of 3 to create a website for Cystic Fibrosis of South Florida.
The website will contain information pertaining to the the story of little girl named Delaney, diagnosed with 
Cystic Fibrosis from birth. In addition to the basic information about the autoimmune disease and the story of 
delaney, it will include a blog, e-commerce store, donations page, contact us and an events page with the ability 
to register for events.
